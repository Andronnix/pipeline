compile it by suing:
g++ source.cpp

run it for calling:
./a.out \
-I <path to vcf file with vep annotations> \
-TR <text file containing ID's of the trio in order of parent1<TAB>parent2<TAB>child > \
-O <output file> \
-T <probability threshold, put 0.9> \
-E <ExAC allele frequency threshold, put 0.001> \
-A <unrelated samples allele frequency threshold, put 0.01>

the argument -TR is simply a text file containing one line with the ID's of the samples of the trio separated by TAB\
